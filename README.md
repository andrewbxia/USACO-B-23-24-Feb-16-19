# USACO-B 23-24 Feb 16-19 (1000/1000) in 2:25
My solutions for USACO Bronze for the Feb 16-19 competition as I submitted them to the servers (along with test case results in comments)!  
I'm mainly using this as an opportunity to introduce myself to the markdown language and documenting my own events!

## IMPORTANT INFO
I suck at coding so these will probably not be the best solutions :( and/or not be \**fully*\* optimized  
These will be my first few steps for my USACO journey as I (hopefully) progress through the levels!  
The IDE I used [(ide.usaco.guide)](https://ide.usaco.guide)

## Problem Descriptions
If you want me to add comments to the code to textualize my solution open an issue yelling at me to do so!
- Problem 1: [Palindrome Game](./solutions/palindromegame.cpp)
- Problem 2: [Milk Exchange](./solutions/milk-exchange.cpp)
- Problem 3: [Maximizing Productivity](./solutions/maximizingproductivity.cpp)

Additional Stuff:
- Extra: [My Thought Processes](./thoughtprocesses.txt)
